## Cats Application

*To run in production mode:*

Install dependencies:
	
	npm install

	OR

	yarn

To serve the application using an express server utilizing a pre-built bundle:
		
	npm run prod

	OR

	yarn prod

and the application is available on localhost:3000

Possible optimizations:
- Code splitting to reduce bundle size and dynamic imports usage.
- Save breeds locally to avoid some requests.
- Add tests.
